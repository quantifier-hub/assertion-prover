I DEPLOYING THE ASSERTION-CLIENT

 The prover is running as a cloud service that processes assertion-files
sent using the client 'assertion/Client.class' which comprises a java-package.

The client gets easily deployed on any system where a stable internet connection,
a Java Runtime Environment (JRE, visit www.java.com for more information)
as well as a terminal console (command prompt) are accessible:

  * place the folder 'assertion' containing 'Client.class' in a folder <dir> on your system,
    typing subsequently in a terminal console
    

       cd <dir>
       java assertion.Client <path to an assertion-prover file>


    to transfer <an assertion-prover file> to the server for processing.    


For instance, if the file 'misc.ap' resides in the folder '<dir>/examples' then

      cd <dir>
      java assertion.Client examples/misc.ap

(on some systems one has to use backslashes: examples\misc.ap)
requests the server to process the content of 'misc.ap' 
which results in a response sent back to the client.

NOTE: NO DATA gets collected by the server except basic connection related statistics.

There is currently a slot of about 30 seconds for such a request:
the connection to the server gets closed straight when the limit is exceeded.

This limit can however be extended to 90 seconds using subscription.


II SUBSCRIPTION 

 In addition to the slot extension, during the subscribed period
each purchased token entitles a designated client program to

   * access a significantly more powerful server

   * optional generation of proofs for confirmed assertions
     (see https://github.com/quantifier-hub/assertion-prover/blob/main/client_manual.pdf for details)
     

The price of one token:  € 50  for 30 days.
