License Agreement


§ 1 Preamble

The aim of this license agreement is to enable free non-commercial use
of the software that is described in the sequel. In order to guarantee
this, it is necessary to set up rules for the use of the software that
hold for any user.

Provider  of this license is  'quantifier.cloud'  ("license provider"
in  the sequel).  The license provider has   developed  a  prover for
the first-order predicate logic that includes a collection of modules
(called "software" in the sequel) written in the programming language
OCaml (see ocaml.org for more details).

Following  the ideas of  open source  software,  the  license provider
gives access to the software  without fee  for anyone (called "license
taker" in the sequel) under the following conditions which are similar
to the Lesser Gnu  Public License (LGPL).  Each license taker  obliges
himself to follow the terms of this agreement.



§ 2 Principles

Each license taker appreciates the terms of use and  receives a simple
right, not resctricted in  time and space and  without any fee, to use
the software  in scientific research and education and, in particular,
to copy, distribute and process it. Exclusively the following terms of
use  do  hold.   The  licence  provider  explicitly   contradicts  any
conflicting terms of use.



§ 3 Copying

Any  license  taker  has  the right to make and distribute  unmodified
copies of the software on any media. Prerequisite is that this license
agreement is clearly recognisable and that the sources are included in
any distribution.



§ 4 Modification and Distribution

Any license taker has the right  to modify copies of the software  (or
parts  thereof) and to distribute these  modifications under the terms
of § 3 above and the following conditions:

1. The modified software has to carry a clear  mark that points to the
   original  license  provider, the modification  that  has been made,
   and the date of the modification.

2. The license taker has to  ensure that the  software  as a whole  or
   parts of it are accessible to third parties under the terms of this
   license agreement without any fees.

3. If during the modification a copyright of the license taker emerges
   then this copyright must be put under the terms  of this license if
   the modified software is distributed.



§ 5 Other duties

1. Reference to  the validity  of this license agreement  must not  be
   modified or deleted by any license taker.

2. The use of the software by third parties must not be conditioned by
   the  fulfilment  of  duties  that are not mentioned in this license
   agreement.

3. The  use of the software  must  not be prevented  or complicated by
   means of technical protection, in particular copy protection means.



§ 6 Liability, Update

1. Liability   of the  license  provider  is restricted  to fraudulent
   withheld factual or legal errors.  The license  provider  does  not
   give any warranty, not even the implied warranty of merchantability
   or  fitness for a particular purpose. The license provider  neither
   ensures any properties of the software. 

2. The license provider has the right to update these  terms of use at
   any time.



§ 7 Termination through Offence

Any violation of a duty of this agreement automatically terminates the
rights of use for the offender.
