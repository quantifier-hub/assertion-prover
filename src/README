This folder contains a basic implementation of the 'assertion' prover
written in the programming language OCaml (see ocaml.org for details).
The modules are organised as a 'dune' project and can thus be compiled
by running 'dune build'.

A few example assertions can be found in 'examples/examples.ap'.

See LICENSE for more details.
